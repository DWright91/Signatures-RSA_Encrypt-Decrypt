# Signatures-RSA_Encrypt-Decrypt

RSA Encrypt/Decrypt Problem: Using openssl â€“ read associated man pages on the virtual machine.

1. (10 Points) Use openssl routines to decrypt the message:
hw3_msg
The RSA key to decrypt this message is:
private_key_1.pem
These files are located in the CourseInfo folder of the CourseFiles for this class.
Turn in script output showing the sequence of commands you used along with the
decrypted message.

2. (15 Points) Create a public and private key for RSA encryption/decryption.
Digitally sign a document:
- create your document
- sign SHA1 hash of document
Show that you can verify the signature of the digitally signed document.
Turn in script output showing the sequence of commands you used and output
generated.
